# StayPinned

**StayPinned** prevents accidental navigation away from your pinned tabs. When you're focused on a pinned tab and click on links, encounter automatic redirects, or perform omnibar searches that don't match the pinned tab's hostname, StayPinned automatically opens the new URLs in a separate tab. This ensures your pinned tabs remain consistent and accessible.

## Possible Future Features

- When trying to open a website that already exists in a pinned tab, activate that pinned tab instead
